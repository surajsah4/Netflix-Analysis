# Netflix Data Analysis Project

In this project, I embarked on a deep dive into the vast ocean of Netflix data to uncover hidden insights and trends. Armed with Excel, MySQL, and Power BI, I navigated through the complexities of the dataset, transforming raw data into actionable insights.

Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Using Excel, I meticulously cleaned and transformed the Netflix data, ensuring its accuracy and consistency. This step was crucial in preparing the data for further analysis, allowing me to eliminate duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats.

Insights Extraction with MySQL:
Next, I tapped into the power of MySQL to extract valuable insights from the cleaned dataset. Leveraging SQL queries, I explored the data to uncover patterns in viewer preferences, content popularity, and regional trends. From top-rated genres to binge-worthy shows, every query unearthed fascinating nuggets of information.

Visualization with Power BI Dashboards:
With the insights in hand, I embarked on the journey of visual storytelling using Power BI. Designing interactive dashboards, I brought the data to life, allowing stakeholders to explore trends and patterns with ease. From dynamic filters to drill-down capabilities, the dashboards provided a comprehensive view of the analyzed data, empowering decision-makers with actionable insights.

Skills Development and Impact:
Throughout this project, I honed my skills in data analysis, SQL querying, and dashboard design. Each step challenged me to think critically, problem-solve creatively, and communicate effectively. Moreover, the project's impact extended beyond the realm of data analysis, fostering a deeper understanding of viewer behavior and content preferences.
